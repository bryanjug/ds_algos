//ALGORITHMS AND PROBLEM SOLVING PATTERNS
//UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM
//Can I restate the problem in my own words?
//What are the inputs and outputs?
//Do I have enough information to solve?
//How should I label the important parts of data that are a part of the problem?

//EXPLORE EXAMPLES
//Start with simple examples
//progress to complex examples
//explore examples with empty inputs
//explore examples with invalid inputs

//BREAK IT DOWN
//write out steps => highlights problems

//SOLVE / SIMPLIFY
//solve, if you cant, solve a simpler problem
//find difficulty and temporarily ignore it
//write a simplified solution
//incorporate difficulty back in

//LOOK BACK AND REFACTOR
//can you check the result?
//can you solve it differently?
//can you understand it at a glance?
//can you use the result / method for another problem?
//can you improve the performance?
//can you think of other ways to refactor?
//how have others solved the problem?

//MASTER PROBLEM SOLVING PATTERNS
//frequency pattern
//multiple pointers
//sliding window
//divide and conquer
//dynamic programming
//greedy algorithms
//backtracking

//find if second object contains squared values in first object
//same([1,2,3], [4,1,9]) = true
//same([1,2,1], [1,9]) = false
//same([1,2,1], [4,4,1]) = false
